        Having enjoyed considerable success in world sportscars, where he helped
        nurture the emerging talents of future F1 stars Michael Schumacher and
        Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Peter Sauber guided his eponymous squad into F1
        in 1993. The team has since established itself as a mainstay of the
        grid, becoming race winners under BMWâ€™s brief ownership, and developing
        a well-earned reputation not only for producing competitive cars, but
        also for developing young drivers. In recent seasons they raced under
        the Alfa Romeo name - and in 2026 will become the works Audi squad - but
        for 2024 a new title sponsor brings a new identity to the famous Swiss
        team.
